# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
#Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I'll be visualizing her campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. With a report attached based on my analysis and visualization i'll create, she'll have a better understanding of her fundraising projections.
