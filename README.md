# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I'll be visualizing her campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. With a report attached based on my analysis and visualization i'll create, she'll have a better understanding of her fundraising projections.
### Purpose

Louise is looking forward to your analysis, but she would benefit from additional visualization of the data so that she can see the outcomes of all the categories. By creating summary tables, charts, and graphs, we can help Louise find the best path towards success.
## Analysis and Challenges

By applying filters and using Pivot tables, we've been able to get a clearer picture on the outcomes of Louise's Kickstarter campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Analyzing our Pivot Table, we can conclude that the most successful years of the campaign are in 2014, 2015 and 2016 were the most impactful and had the most success. It can also be concluded that the effectiveness of the campaign started to dwindle in 2017. May, June and February were also the most successful with respect to the campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

By analyzing our outcomes based on goals, it is evident that there were no plays that were cancelled from a goal range of less than 1000 t0 50000 or more. 100% of plays failed ranging from 45000 to 49999, with the second highest number of plays that failed ranging from 50000 or more at 87.50%, and in third place for percentage of failed plays ranging from 25000 to 29999.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Upon receipt of the initial worksheet, some conditional formatting and filters had to be completed and selected as preferences to enable us scrum the dataset for more relevant information. We also had to create graphs and tables to help understand the trends of her outcomes. We also had to use descriptive statistics to understand the average goal and identify outliers based on her targets.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

By extracting the information from our Kickstarter workbook, we've been able to narrow down our search for outcomes, realizing that the best months for the campaign we're in May, June and February. We can also conclude that the months that had the most failed campaigns, were in January, June and October. The Kickstarter campaign was also a success overall with focus primarily in the US and Great Britain market.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

By analyzing our outcomes based on goals, it is evident that there were no plays that were cancelled from a goal range of less than 1000 t0 50000 or more. 100% of plays failed ranging from 45000 to 49999, with the second highest number of plays that failed ranging from 50000 or more at 87.50%, and in third place for percentage of failed plays ranging from 25000 to 29999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset had to be modified several times to obtain a clearer overall picture of the relevant information was looking for. There were also some challenges that had to be fixed/corrected with an IFERROR command to keep our data concise and informative.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some other tables and graphs we could possibly create to have a better understanding and perspective on the goals and outcomes of our plays are Stacked Bar charts and pie chart to assist with the realization of successes and failures of Louise's play.
