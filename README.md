# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I'll be visualizing her campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. With a report attached based on my analysis and visualization i'll create, she'll have a better understanding of her fundraising projections.
### Purpose
Louise is looking forward to your analysis, but she would benefit from additional visualization of the data so that she can see the outcomes of all the categories. By creating summary tables, charts, and graphs, we can help Louise find the best path towards success.
## Analysis and Challenges
By applying filters and using Pivot tables, we've been able to get a clearer picture on the outcomes of the fundraising outcomes.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Analyzing our Pivot Table, we can conclude that the most successful years of the campaign are in 2014, 2015 and 2016 were the most impactful and had the most success. It can also be concluded that the effectiveness of the campaign started to dwindle in 2017.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
By analyzing our outcomes based on goals, it is evident that there were no plays that were cancelled from a goal range of less than 1000 t0 50000 or more. 100% of plays failed ranging from 45000 to 49999, with the second highest number of plays that failed ranging from 50000 or more at 87.50%, and in third place for percentage of failed plays ranging from 25000 to 29999.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
By extracting the information from our Kickstarter workbook, we've been able to narrow down our search for outcomes, realizing that the best months for the campaign we're in May, June and February
We can also conclude that the months that had the most failed campaigns, were in January, June and October.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
